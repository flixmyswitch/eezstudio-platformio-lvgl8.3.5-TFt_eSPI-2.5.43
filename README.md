Ok I have been trying for three days to convert an EEZStudio project that complies and runs when using the Arduino IDE.  I have been trying to use Vscode and platformio.

The code complies and uploads to an elecrow 3.5" esp32 tft touch screen.  The images appear but when pressing either of the buttons the screen crashes.  No info
is sent to the serial monitor apart from what looks like a crash report.

So its uses the VARS files and I think it this that make the screen crash
